#Repository pattern
Repository pattern is a software design pattern that provides an abstraction of data, so that your application can work with a simple abstraction that has an interface. Using this pattern can help achieve loose coupling and can keep domain objects persistence ignorant.

It also makes code more testable as it allows us to inject as a dependency a mock repository that implements that defined interface.
